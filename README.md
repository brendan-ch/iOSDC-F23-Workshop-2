# iOS Developers Club: Building User Interfaces

This repository contains project files for the iOS Developers Club.

## Setup

To run this app, you'll need to setup your own Firebase configuration and replace the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file with your own.

1. Open the project in Xcode. Change the **bundle identifier** to anything you'd like in reverse domain notation. Make a note of this identifier.
2. Go to [firebase.com](https://firebase.com).
3. Click **Get Started**, and sign into your Google account.
4. Create a new project. Name it **SwiftUIToDoList**, or anything youâ€™d like. Use the default configuration, and select the default analytics account.
5. Click Create.
6. On the home page, click the **iOS** icon.
7. Paste the **bundle identifier** from step #1 into the **Apple bundle ID** field. Give your app a nickname.
8. Download the **config file** so your app can connect to Firebase.
9. Drag and drop the config file into Xcode.
